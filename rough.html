  I have undergone a rigorous 8 month coding training through the Foundation.
  While there, I learnt and developed a page, a website, a weather app and more.
  All that included lessons on CSS,JS,API,all matters hosting and more. After
  each class, a challenge was given to encourage individual practice. SheCodes
  made learning manageable and fun.
